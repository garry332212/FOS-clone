              We started this business out of a storeroom next to a garage in
              2019 (so you can call us a storeroom start-up ðŸ˜Š). We started out
              with a goal of identifying pain points and needs of service
              businesses, that were not being addressed, keeping in mind we do
              not re-invent the wheel!{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              After a good 10 months of researching, brainstorming and white
              boarding ideas with our friends, colleagues, and industry contacts
              from NZ, AUS, USA and Asian markets we started building the
              <span> fleetonstreet</span> prototype app. We engaged several
              businesses to work with us to validate and test ride the features
              as we built them.
            </p>

            <p>
              Fast forward to today, with tens of thousands of jobs been
              serviced and managed, thousands of clients in our database and
              hundreds of happy business users, we are on a journey to enable
              our customers manage and optimize all key processes of their
              businesses
